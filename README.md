# QuestPinning
A simple QOL mod that lets you pin quests to the main hud.

- Pinned quests will flash in the hud after you dismiss the catch dialogue to show you progress
- Pinned quests will save and be persistent between game launches
- Works with vanilla players :3

Future features:
- have better indication that a pinned quest is complete
- fix the bugs (it's pretty rough)
